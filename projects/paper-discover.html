        <h2>What Paper Discover Does</h2>
        <p>Paper Discover is a lightweight research exploration tool that helps users understand what’s being published, where, and how fields are evolving — without needing to manually sift through thousands of papers.</p>
        <p>Instead of keyword-only search, the app lets users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browse papers by discipline</li>
          <li>See publication trends over time</li>
          <li>Get high-level summaries and insights across abstracts and topics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal is not to replace deep reading, but to make the discovery phase faster and more intuitive.</p>

        <h2>How the Product Works (Conceptually)</h2>
        <p>At a high level, Paper Discover has three main layers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple, responsive interface for exploring papers</li>
          <li>A backend that normalizes and serves publication data</li>
          <li>Optional AI-powered insights to summarize trends across many papers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each part is intentionally kept modular so the system is easy to extend and reason about.</p>

        <h2>Data Ingestion &amp; Curation</h2>
        <p>Paper data is sourced from the Springer Open Access API and periodically synced into the app’s database.</p>
        <p>Rather than querying external APIs directly from the browser, all data is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fetched server-side</li>
          <li>Cleaned and normalized</li>
          <li>Stored in a structured database</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This allows the app to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Respond quickly to user queries</li>
          <li>Support aggregation (e.g. counts by date or discipline)</li>
          <li>Avoid rate limits and inconsistent upstream responses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An admin-only sync endpoint handles ingestion, making it easy to refresh or expand the dataset without impacting users.</p>

        <h2>Exploring Papers in the App</h2>
        <p>Once data is ingested, users can explore it in a few ways:</p>

        <h3>Browsing by Discipline</h3>
        <p>Each paper can belong to multiple disciplines. These are stored as structured metadata rather than free text, which makes it possible to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filter reliably</li>
          <li>Rank popular disciplines</li>
          <li>Compare fields side by side</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Viewing Publication Trends</h3>
        <p>To help users see how research evolves over time, the app aggregates papers by publication date and surfaces this data visually. This makes it easy to answer questions like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Is this field growing quickly?”</li>
          <li>“When did interest peak?”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reading Abstracts in Context</h3>
        <p>Instead of isolating each paper, the interface encourages scanning across abstracts to get a sense of common themes before diving deeper.</p>

        <h2>AI-Powered Insights (Optional by Design)</h2>
        <p>Paper Discover includes an optional AI insights feature that summarizes patterns across multiple abstracts.</p>
        <p>This is intentionally:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not a replacement for reading</li>
          <li>Not positioned as authoritative</li>
          <li>Clearly labeled as a synthesis tool</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal is to help users orient themselves quickly — especially when entering an unfamiliar field.</p>
        <p>I designed this feature conservatively, focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aggregation rather than interpretation</li>
          <li>Transparency over confidence</li>
          <li>Human judgment remaining central</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why I Designed It This Way</h2>
        <p>A few guiding principles shaped the product:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clarity over cleverness</strong> — The system favors explicit data flows and readable interfaces over hidden magic.</li>
          <li><strong>Server-side control of data</strong> — All reads and writes go through the backend, which keeps security, validation, and evolution manageable.</li>
          <li><strong>Extensibility</strong> — New data sources, filters, or insight layers can be added without rewriting the core system.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect for the research process</strong> — The tool accelerates discovery but doesn’t pretend to replace expertise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Notes (For Those Who Want Them)</h2>
        <p>For readers interested in implementation details:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The frontend is built with React and Next.js</li>
          <li>Data is stored in PostgreSQL (via Supabase)</li>
          <li>All data access goes through API routes, rather than directly from the browser</li>
          <li>Aggregations and summaries are handled server-side for consistency and performance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These choices reflect a preference for maintainable, production-oriented systems over quick demos.</p>

        <h2>What I’d Explore Next</h2>
        <p>If this were taken further, I’d be interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Supporting multiple publication sources</li>
          <li>Adding saved views for specific research interests</li>
          <li>Personalized recommendations for authenticated users based on their research interests</li>
          <li>Surfacing changes over time within individual disciplines</li>
          <li>Improving evaluation and transparency around AI-generated insights</li>
        </ul>
